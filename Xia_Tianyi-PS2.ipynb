    "## Introduction to the assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be using data from the [Progresa program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oportunidades), a government social assistance program in Mexico. This program, as well as the details of its impact, are described in the paper \"[School subsidies for the poor: evaluating the Mexican Progresa poverty program](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387803001858)\", by Paul Shultz (available on bCourses). Please familiarize yourself with the PROGRESA program before beginning this problem set, so you have a rough sense of where the data come from and how they were generated. If you just proceed into the problem set without understanding Progresa or the data, it will be very difficult!\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this problem set is to implement some of the basic econometric techniques that you are learning in class to measure the impact of Progresa on secondary school enrollment rates. The timeline of the program was:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Baseline survey conducted in 1997\n",
    " * Intervention begins in 1998, \"Wave 1\" of surveys conducted in 1998\n",
    " * \"Wave 2\" of surveys conducted in 1999\n",
    " * Evaluation ends in 2000, at which point the control villages were treated. \n",
    " \n",
    "When you are ready, download the progresa_sample.csv data from bCourses. The data are actual data collected to evaluate the impact of the Progresa program.  In this file, each row corresponds to an observation taken for a given child for a given year. There are two years of data (1997 and 1998), and just under 40,000 children who are surveyed in each year. For each child-year observation, the following variables are collected:\n",

    "* A: There're 8 different variables whose p-value are less than 0.05 between the treatment and control group at baseline, which indicates the statistically significant differences. \n",
    "* B: Baseline differences matter because they indicate pre-existing disparities between treatment and control groups before the intervention. Baseline differences between groups can confound the interpretation of post-treatment outcomes, making it challenging to attribute observed effects solely to the intervention. Significant differences at baseline can indicate problems with the randomization process, suggesting that the random assignment might not have been properly executed or that the sample size is too small to balance all covariates by chance. In some contexts, particularly in policy research and program evaluation, baseline differences might raise concerns about equity and fairness of the intervention.\n",
    "* C: The The presence of statistically significant differences at baseline implies the need for careful adjustment in the impact analysis to account for these initial disparities. Also, the presence of statistically significant differences at baseline implies the need for careful adjustment in the impact analysis to account for these initial disparities. We must take these differences into account when interpreting the results to ensure the validity of the conclusions. Moreover, given the baseline differences, a DiD approach could help mitigate some concerns by focusing on changes over time within each group, assuming parallel trends. "

    "Visualize the distribution of village enrollment rates **among poor households in treated villages**, before and after treatment. Specifically, for each village, calculate the average rate of enrollment of poor households in treated villages in 1997, then compute the average rate of enrollment of poor households in treated villages in 1998. Create two separate histograms showing the distribution of these average enrollments rates, one histogram for 1997 and one histogram for 1998. On each histogram, draw a vertical line that intersects the x-axis at the average value (across all households). Does there appear to be a difference? Is this difference statistically significant?"

Use a t-test to determine if this difference is statistically significant. What do you conclude?"

    "1. * The coefficient for progresa is 0.0075 with a standard error of 0.004. This suggests that, on its own, being in the Progresa program is associated with an increase in the likelihood of a child's enrollment in school by 0.75 percentage points. However, this effect is not statistically significant at conventional levels (p-value = 0.091), which means we do not have enough evidence to confidently say that Progresa has had an effect on school enrollment when not considering the time dimension.\n",
    "   *  The coefficient for treatment_post is 0.0313 with a standard error of 0.006. This is the DiD estimate and suggests that the Progresa program, after accounting for the time effect, is associated with an increase in school enrollment by 3.13 percentage points from 1997 to 1998 for poor households. This effect is statistically significant (p-value = 0.000), which indicates a strong and significant impact of the program when comparing the change over time between the treatment and control groups.\n",
    "2. *  The point estimate for the Progresa effect has decreased slightly from 0.0075 to 0.0043. This reduction implies that part of the effect captured by the progresa variable alone may be explained by other factors that are now included in the model. The Progresa coefficient is not statistically significant in either model. However, the p-value has increased from 0.091 to 0.256, indicating even less statistical evidence for a Progresa effect when controlling for other variables.\n",
    "   *  The inclusion of control variables, which show significant associations with enrollment, implies that these factors (like age, distance to school, gender, household head's education, and indigenous status) are important in determining school enrollment. They may overshadow the isolated impact of the Progresa program.\n",
    "3. * After considering the control variables, the coefficient of progresa decreased from 0.0354 to 0.0314, but remains positive. The initial model without control variables might have over-estimated the effect of Progresa if it failed to account for other important factors that influence enrollment. It suggestes that we have to include all relevant variables that explain the outcome.\n",
    "4. * The counterfactual assumption in regression model ii is that, in the absence of Progresa, the relationship between the control variables (age, distance to school, sex, household head's education, etc.) and the likelihood of school enrollment would be the same for the treatment group as for the control group. That means, including the control variables, the differences in enrollment rates betweem the Progresa and non-Progresa groups can be attributed to the Progresa program itself."
